# BexPad
OSU MiniPad Arduino firmware for two key devices, to use with SAMD21.

There is now a calibration file, it will tell you current values read from analog sensors, so you can set maximum to when key is fully pressed and minimum when its fully released. Use sam cDIV and resolution values as in the main file.

On Arduino Zero, Key 1 is pin A0 and Key 2 is pin A1.
